# Ugly tic-tac-toe

Literally just an ugly tic-tac-toe.

## Objectives

- Get more familiar with the very basics of SDL2.
- To start creating a first SDL2 boilerplate for next projects.

## Post-Mortem

- It works, but heck did I ever made an ugly tic-tac-toe before.
- The input logic works by checking which quadrant the mouse is on the window; this wouldn't work if the window wasn't a square.
- Game only works by playing it on super-folder ("./bin/main"), because of font being loaded on "current" folder.
